# Babble
## Change application languages. Crazy

### Intro
Babble is a jailbreak extension for iOS that allows the user to change the language of a specific app.

NOTE: I haven't had time yet to make this user friendly (and it only supports dict cc plus atm since I don't need it in other apps). In the (hopefully near) future you will be able to specify applications and their corresponding display languages through Preferences.

### How do I Babble?
Just install the tweak.

### How do I get?
Compile it for yourself or use the .deb included.

### How do I compile?
You should know that. :P

### License?
Pretty much the BSD license, just don't repackage it and call it your own please!

Also if you do make some changes, feel free to make a pull request and help make things more awesome!
